You objective is to move the runner using'a' 's' 'd' 'w' to the opposite end zone. If you run into the defenders, however, you will be tackled and lose the game. </p>

  <p>Description:The theme for this sketch was to make a meme of a fallacy. I chose to do the argument for authority fallacy, which is the fallacy that is using the words of someone who claims to be an expert, rather than logic or evidence to support their argument. So, in my sketch I play the role of the expert of lemons and I say mine are the best because I said so. You can interact with this sketch by scrolling over the image and clicking on the image. Scrolling over the image will show the text and clicking on the image will change the background, which in turn changes the text. </p>
